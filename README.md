# totk-save-state
A WIP save-state tool for the game "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom"

## Current Notes
This was forked from [botw-save-state](https://github.com/Pistonight/botw-save-state) and is in very early stages.

Currently attempting:
- Swap out botw name everywhere for totk
- Shift dev environment to use docker containers
